  <h2>What is Deep Sea Mining?</h2>
  <p>Deep sea mining is the extraction of valuable minerals from the ocean floor, including cobalt, nickel, copper, and rare earth elements. These materials are often used to make electronics, electric car batteries, and other energy technologies.</p>

  <p>Although these minerals can contribute to the reduction of pollution, many of these mines are on extremely fragile ecosystems such as hydrothermal vents and abyssal plains. Organisms in the deep sea have taken millions of years to adapt to the conditions, and disrupting their environments could cause permanent damage.</p>

  <p>According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, over <strong>1.5 million km²</strong> of seabed are already under mining licenses — nearly the size of Alaska (<a href="https://www.iucn.org/resources/issues-brief/deep-sea-mining" target="_blank">IUCN</a>).</p>
