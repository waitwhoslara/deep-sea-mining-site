  <h2>What is Deep Sea Mining?</h2>
  <p>Deep sea mining is the extraction of valuable minerals from the ocean floor, including cobalt, nickel, copper, and rare earth elements. These materials are often used to make electronics, electric vehicle batteries, and other clean energy technologies.</p>

  <p>While these minerals may help reduce our reliance on fossil fuels, the method of obtaining them raises major environmental concerns. Many proposed mining sites are located in delicate marine ecosystems like hydrothermal vents and abyssal plains. These habitats are home to species that have evolved under stable, extreme conditions for millions of years. Disrupting them could lead to irreversible ecological damage.</p>

  <p>The mining process also stirs up sediment plumes that can smother marine life and spread toxins. Noise, vibration, and artificial light further disturb the quiet, dark conditions that deep-sea species depend on.</p>

  <p>According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, more than <strong>1.5 million km²</strong> of ocean floor are currently covered by mining exploration licenses — an area nearly the size of Alaska (<a href="https://www.iucn.org/resources/issues-brief/deep-sea-mining" target="_blank">IUCN</a>).</p>
